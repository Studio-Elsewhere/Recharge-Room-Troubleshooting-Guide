You will then see a category with all of our available nature scenes. To activate any of these scenes, simply say **"Ok Google, activate.."** followed by the name of the scene.

With your voice command, the room will automatically select visuals, sounds, and colors to display your scene, providing an immersive experience.

To head to another scene at any given time, repeat **"Ok Google, activate.."** followed by the name of your desired scene.
